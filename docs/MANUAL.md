# Nupplo SE – The Manual

*July 2026 · [🇩🇪 Deutsche Fassung](HANDBUCH.md)*

*Nupplo SE (Server Edition) is the edition you run yourself. Up to version 2.92 it was called “Brickfolio”.*

Nupplo is a self-hosted Progressive Web App (PWA) for scanning, managing
and valuing a LEGO® collection. This manual explains every feature – from the
first start to a day at the flea market.

## 1. About Nupplo

Nupplo follows three basic ideas:

**Adding something should take seconds.** Photograph a figure or a set with
your phone, tap the match, pick the condition – done. Recognition is handled
by the free [Brickognize API](https://brickognize.com); names and metadata
come from Rebrickable and BrickLink.

**The collection should know what it is worth.** BrickLink average prices are
fetched automatically and recorded continuously – from that come price
histories per item and the value trend of the whole collection.

**Your data stays with you.** Everything runs in a single Docker container on
your own server (FastAPI + SQLite). There is no Nupplo service in between
that you would have to sign up for, and your collection lives nowhere else.
Several family members share one database, each with their own login.

The app only reaches outside where it has to: for scanning (Brickognize), for
search by name (Rebrickable) and for prices and set contents (BrickLink). The
latter two need your own free access – see 2.4. Without them everything else
keeps working.

**One point that is easily missed: the images.** The database holds only the
*address* of each item's catalogue picture. It used to be fetched by **your
browser** directly from `img.bricklink.com`, `cdn.rebrickable.com` or – for
anything scanned – `storage.googleapis.com`, where Brickognize keeps its
thumbnails. Nothing from your collection went out, but the image address names
the part number, and every time you browsed, such a request went off.

**Since 1.61.0 the pictures live on your instance.** When an item is added the
server fetches its picture once, scales it down to 400 pixels and stores it
next to the database (`data/catalog/`). After that the browser only ever asks
**your own instance** – nothing goes outside any more. Older items are caught
up by **More → 🖼 Images on your instance**; the card says how many are
missing and works through them in portions.

The fetch can only ever reach the four catalogue hosts – it is no route to the
outside, and dedicated tests watch over that. The file name is derived from the
image address **and your instance's key**; without it nobody can work out from
a part number whether that picture is stored here.

Roughly 10–25 KB per item, so 1000 items are about 15–25 MB on disk. They are
**not** part of the JSON backup – that stays small, and the button fetches lost
pictures again at any time.

If you like, you can additionally connect your instance to the **trading
network** (chapter 12) – then several households can reach each other. Even
then the collection stays at home: only what someone explicitly offers for
trade goes out, and messages are end-to-end encrypted.

**The technology in one sentence:** Python backend (FastAPI) with an SQLite
database, vanilla-JS frontend without a build step, installable as a PWA on
your home screen.

## 2. Installation & first setup

### 2.1 Requirements

- A server with Docker and Docker Compose (tested on Synology DSM among
  others); 512 MB of RAM is enough.
- For prices and the like: free API access at BrickLink and Rebrickable
  (see 2.4 – the app also works without, then without prices and search by
  name).

### 2.2 Installation

There is a ready-made image – nothing to build, no source code needed:

```bash
mkdir nupplo && cd nupplo
curl -sLo docker-compose.yml https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Melle79/nupplo/main/docker-compose.example.yml
docker compose up -d
```

The app is then reachable at `http://<server>:8300`. The database lives
persistently at `./data/brickfolio.db` – that folder survives updates and
container rebuilds.

The image exists on two registries (identical in content, pick one):
`ghcr.io/melle79/nupplo:latest` and `melle79/nupplo:latest`. It is
built for **amd64** (Intel/AMD, most NAS boxes) and **arm64** (Raspberry Pi,
ARM NAS, Apple Silicon). Very old 32-bit ARM devices are not supported.

**Without a shell**, e.g. on a Synology: the Container Manager interface takes
the same YAML. Step by step in [`SYNOLOGY.md`](SYNOLOGY.md) (in German); for
other vendors the README lists where the respective dialog sits.

**Building it yourself** (only needed for your own changes): fetch the source
and replace the `image: …` line in `docker-compose.yml` with `build: .`, then
`docker compose up -d --build`.

**Changing the port / running several instances:** the reachable port is the
*first* number in the `ports` mapping of `docker-compose.yml` – `"8301:8300"`
makes the app available on port 8301 (the second number always stays 8300).
That is also how you run several Nupplo instances side by side, e.g. for
separate collections or a test installation: its own folder, its own
`container_name`, its own port – every instance has its own `data/` folder and
therefore its own database.

**Synology note:** create the folder under `/volume1/docker/nupplo` and
run all commands over SSH with `sudo`.

### 2.3 First start: the setup wizard

On the first visit in the browser you pick a username and password for the
**admin account**. Right above those fields you also choose the **language**
(German or English) – the choice goes into the profile of the account you are
about to create, so it applies on every device.

After that you are signed in, and a wizard walks you through the rest in eight
steps:

1. **Display name** – the name in the logo, the window title, the **app icon**,
   the small icon in the browser tab and the name on the phone's home screen
   ("Anna's Nupplo")
2. **Price region and currency** – which market the average prices come from
   and in which currency; preselected is what matches your browser's language
   settings (see chapter 13.1)
3. **Rebrickable key** – for search by name, with a direct link
4. **BrickLink access** – the four values for prices and set contents
5. **Test the connection** – a real test call to both services, so a mixed-up
   key shows up now and not at your first scan
6. **Trading network** – if somebody invited you (see chapter 12)
7. **Secure with two-factor** – recommended once the app is reachable from
   outside (see chapter 3.1). The password from creating the account is
   already filled in; scan the QR code, type the code, keep the recovery codes
8. **Done**

**Every step can be skipped**, and at the bottom there is "Finish the wizard
and get started". Without keys everything works except prices, set contents
and search by name – **scanning needs no key at all**. Anything can be added
later under *More → API keys*.

The wizard runs exactly once, right after the admin account is created.

**Moving from another instance?** Then create nothing here: below the create
button sits **"📥 Restore a backup"**. It brings the whole old state across –
collection, lists, purchase book **and the accounts**. Afterwards you sign in
with your **existing credentials** – same name, same password as before.

> The sign-in form deliberately names no one: it is a page where nobody is
> signed in yet, and whoever restored the backup knows their own credentials
> anyway.

> The other way round would be awkward: an admin account created here would be
> overwritten by the restore straight away, because the backup brings its own
> users. Hence the separate route before signing in.
>
> **Why does this work without signing in?** Because it only works while the
> instance is **empty**. Anyone who reaches it in that state could simply
> create the first admin account and own everything anyway. As soon as one
> user exists the route is closed – from then on it runs through
> *More → Backup* and a signed-in admin.

*For unattended setups:* if the environment variables
`ADMIN_USER`/`ADMIN_PASSWORD` are set, Nupplo creates the admin on the
very first start; the wizard is then skipped and the keys come either from
environment variables or from *More → API keys*.

### 2.4 Setting up API keys (admin)

Under **More → API keys** (only visible to admins):

**BrickLink** – provides average prices, release years and set contents:

1. You need a BrickLink account **with an opened store** – the store API is
   only open to sellers. The store does not have to sell anything, it just
   has to exist (BrickLink: *My Store*).
2. On [API → Register Consumer](https://www.bricklink.com/v2/api/register_consumer.page)
   accept the terms and create an **access token**. Fill **both IP fields**
   (IP address *and* mask) with `0.0.0.0` – that allows access from any
   address.
3. Copy the four values – *Consumer Key*, *Consumer Secret*, *Token*,
   *Token Secret* – into the four fields in the app and save.
4. Below that is **Operator's contact address**. BrickLink's terms of use
   require a visible contact address in the application. **Not for
   BrickLink** – they know you from your registration – but so that
   **strangers using your instance** can reach you. The field is therefore
   not transmitted anywhere; it is only displayed.

   **If the instance runs only for you and your family, leave it empty.**
   Anyone who can ask at the kitchen table needs no email address on a page.
   The field only starts to make sense once you give an account to someone
   outside the household, or make the instance publicly reachable. They then
   mean **your** address: you registered the access above yourself, which makes you, not
   the project, the operator of this instance as far as BrickLink is
   concerned. The address appears under **More → Legal**, together with the
   notice BrickLink prescribes verbatim. Without BrickLink credentials the
   field has no effect.

### Asking prices (optional)

Under **More → Asking prices** you can switch on a second number: **what the
figure can be had for right now**. The familiar average sold price says what
was actually paid last – what the figure is *worth*. The asking price says
what it *costs* if you buy now.

It appears in the detail view and as a small badge in wanted and shopping
lists – there for the condition the item has on the list (“from … new” or
“from … used”; on the wanted list, used). It is **off** by default: every lookup costs additional BrickLink
requests, and the daily limit is 5,000. Asking prices are **not stored** –
the value of your collection keeps resting on actual sales.

**Rebrickable** – provides search by name:

1. Create a free account on rebrickable.com.
2. Under [Account → API](https://rebrickable.com/api/) create a key and enter
   it in the *Rebrickable Key* field.

Finally press **"Test connection"** – the app checks both and reports the
result. The same instructions live inside the app too: ❓ button at the top
right → "Getting API keys". Stored keys are shown masked; leaving a field
empty when saving keeps the existing value. Alternatively all keys can be set
as environment variables (see README); the settings in the app take
precedence.

### 2.5 Onto your phone as an app (PWA)

If Nupplo is still running in the browser on a phone, the scan page shows
the card **"📲 Add to the home screen"** at the top. What it offers depends on
the device:

- **Android and other Chromium browsers**: "Add it now" triggers the
  installation directly.
- **iPhone and iPad**: Safari has no button for this – the card explains the
  route via *Share → "Add to Home Screen"*.
- **Over a plain `http` address on the home network** no browser allows
  adding it. The card then says exactly that and points to *More → External
  access* (2.7), which sets up an encrypted address.

**Pull down to reload.** Started from the home screen there is no address
bar and therefore no reload button; on iOS there is no gesture for it either.
So Nupplo brings its own: at the top of the list, pull down until the
brick turns green, then let go. In the browser it stays off – the address bar
already does that.

As soon as the app runs from the home screen the card disappears by itself –
it detects the display mode. "Don't show again" hides it permanently, per
device.

Once installed, Nupplo starts like a native app in full screen –
including camera access for scanning.

### 2.6 Getting your bearings: header and the More tab

**Opening the page builds the logo.** The four bricks drop in one after
another, then your instance's name, the wordmark and the subtitle appear;
after three seconds the image fades and the content comes up. The name
comes from the server – without a display name set it simply reads
"Nupplo". The image covers the time the app is loading anyway; it does
not add any. With **reduced motion** enabled on the device, the same image
shows briefly without the animation.

> The same four bricks bounce while a list is loading – collection,
> statistics, catalogue, offers. Pull-to-refresh keeps the spinning brick:
> it stands still while you pull and spins once it gets going.


Two companions sit in the header: the **❓ button** (top right) opens the help
as a popup – from any tab. It is deliberately brief: nine collapsible sections,
each a lead sentence and a few points, for the quick answer on the go. Anything
that deserves a fuller explanation lives here in the manual and is linked from
the help. And **your own
name** next to it is tappable: behind it is the **profile popup** with change
username, change password and sign out.

**💬 Unread messages.** If something is waiting in the trade network, a mark
with the number of unread messages appears to the left – visible from every
tab. Tapping it goes straight to *Trade → Messages*. If nothing is
open, there is no mark either. When the app opens, Nupplo asks the hub
once so the number is right immediately instead of after the next cycle.

> **Phone or computer?** The navigation sits **at the bottom on a phone** and
> **as a sidebar on the left on wide screens**. There the app uses the space:
> key figures side by side, and four to five cards per row in the collection
> grid. It is the same app – it just arranges itself according to screen
> width, without you switching anything.

The **More** tab is arranged in four groups, sorted by **who it concerns**.
Cards fold open and shut by tapping the heading; the app remembers the state.
If a whole group is empty for your role, its heading disappears too – so a
regular user only sees the first group and the sources at the very bottom.

| Group | Card | visible to |
|---|---|---|
| 🙋 **For you** | 🌐 Language | everyone |
| | 🎨 Design | everyone |
| | ↕️ Collection sort order | everyone |
| | 📤 Export & print | everyone |
| | 💼 Collector-Pro (offer suggestion, CSV import) | Collector-Pro |
| | 📈 Price log | Collector-Pro |
| 🏠 **This instance** | 🏷 Display name | Admin |
| | 👥 Manage users | Admin |
| | 🔑 API keys | Admin |
| | 🌍 Price region & currency | Admin |
| | 🖼 Images on your instance | Admin |
| 🌐 **Outward** | 🌐 External access | Admin |
| | 🤝 Trading network (connect/disconnect) | Admin |
| 🛠 **Maintenance** | 💾 Backup | Admin |
| | 🔄 Version & updates | Admin |
| | 🐞 Error report | Admin |
| *(no group)* | ℹ️ Sources & legal | everyone |

**🌐 Language** switches between German and English. The choice is stored in
your profile and therefore applies on every device; without one the app
follows your browser language. Switching happens instantly – nothing you have
typed is lost.

**🎨 Design** offers three looks: **Classic** (light, LEGO colours),
**Galaxy** (dark, with a starfield and glowing accents) and **Nova** (a modern
glass design – deep dark, shimmering blue background, translucent surfaces and
a blue accent). The choice is **stored in your profile** and therefore applies
**on every device** once you are signed in. The admin additionally sees a
**star** on every design: ⭐ marks the **default design of the instance**;
tapping the star of another design makes that one the default. It applies to
the login screen and to users who have not chosen for themselves (the star
does not change your own choice).

**ℹ️ Sources & legal** names where data and images come from (Rebrickable,
BrickLink, Brickognize), points out that taking a photo transmits it for
recognition, and lists trademark, font and program licences.

### 2.7 Reaching it from anywhere (Cloudflare Tunnel)

By default Nupplo only runs on your **home network**. If you also want
access from elsewhere (phone on mobile data, another location), you should
**not open ports on your router** – that exposes the server to the whole
internet. The recommendation instead is a **Cloudflare Tunnel**: safer,
simpler and free.

**Why a Cloudflare Tunnel**

- **No open port.** The tunnel builds an *outgoing* connection to Cloudflare –
  nothing has to be forwarded inwards on the router or NAS. That shrinks the
  attack surface enormously.
- **HTTPS included.** The app is reachable encrypted under its own
  (sub)domain, without you maintaining certificates.
- **Works behind CGNAT** and without a fixed public IP – important on many
  cable and mobile connections.

**Requirement:** a free Cloudflare account and a domain managed at Cloudflare
(register a cheap one or move an existing one).

**Recommended installation** – `cloudflared` as a second container right next
to Nupplo, driven by a tunnel token:

1. In the **Cloudflare Zero Trust** dashboard under *Networks → Tunnels*
   create a tunnel and copy the **token** shown.
2. On the tunnel enter a *Public Hostname*, e.g.
   `nupplo.your-domain.com`, with the service
   **`http://nupplo:8300`** (the container name and port from above).
3. Add this next to the `nupplo` service in `docker-compose.yml`:

   ```yaml
     cloudflared:
       image: cloudflare/cloudflared:latest
       container_name: nupplo-tunnel
       restart: unless-stopped
       command: tunnel run
       environment:
         TUNNEL_TOKEN: "put-the-token-here"
   ```

   Both containers sit on the same compose network, so `cloudflared` reaches
   the app at `http://nupplo:8300`. Then `docker compose up -d`.

Nupplo is then reachable encrypted from anywhere at
`https://nupplo.your-domain.com` – with no port forwarding at all. Over
that address it can also be put on your phone as a PWA (see 2.5).

> **An extra lock (recommended):** in the Zero Trust dashboard you can put an
> **access policy** in front of the app – for example sign-in by one-time
> email code, or a restriction to certain addresses. Then only people
> Cloudflare has confirmed reach the login page at all. For your own family
> the normal Nupplo login is often enough; the access policy is the second
> door for anyone who wants to be certain.

**Several instances** (e.g. one per family member): simply create several
*public hostnames* pointing at the respective container ports – a single
`cloudflared` container is enough for that.

### 2.8 How the app is secured – and what it is not built for

Nupplo is built for the **home network**. If you forward a port on your
router, you should know what protects you and what does not.

**What is there:**

- **Every data access requires a login.** Only the start page, signing in,
  the initial setup and the image files themselves are open (and their names
  are random and cannot be guessed).
- **Passwords** are stored as PBKDF2-SHA256 with 200,000 rounds and a
  per-user salt – not in plain text, not as a simple hash.
- **Password guessing is throttled**: ten failed attempts per account and per
  origin, then a 15-minute pause. The correct password does not count during
  that time either – otherwise someone who just guessed it would slip
  through. A successful login resets the counters.
- **Security headers**: the page cannot be put inside someone else's frame,
  the browser must not guess file types, and a content policy only allows
  scripts from the app itself.
- **Uploaded images** are re-encoded – that strips EXIF data (GPS from phone
  photos, for instance) and makes sure nothing other than an image is stored.
- **Roles**: purchase prices, list management, users, keys and backup all sit
  behind pro or admin rights. **Rights are read fresh from the database on
  every request**, not taken from the session token: if an admin removes
  someone's rights or deletes the account, that takes effect immediately and
  not only when the session expires.
- **Changing a password ends all previous sessions** (since v1.67.0) – on
  every device. If you change your password because a device went missing, you
  really do lock it out; your own device gets a fresh session and stays signed
  in. The same applies when an admin resets a password or removes a second
  factor.
- **Secrets are stripped from every error message** before it is stored or
  sent as a GitHub issue – API keys, GitHub token, hub access, the private hub
  key and the push key. A test fires as soon as a new setting appears that
  nobody has classified as secret or public.
- **`latest` means trusting the registry.** With `:latest` every update pulls
  the newest state from there – even if that account ever fell into the wrong
  hands. If you would rather not, pin a **fixed version**
  (`image: ghcr.io/melle79/nupplo:1.67.0`). Then only what you picked runs.
  > **But:** a fixed version number only fixes the *name*. Whoever controls
  > the registry could serve something else under `1.67.0` just as under
  > `latest`. Real protection comes only from a **digest**
  > (`image: ghcr.io/melle79/nupplo@sha256:…`) – it describes the content
  > itself and cannot be re-pointed. The release page or `docker image
  > inspect` shows the digest.
  >
  > **The price either way:** the update button in the app no longer does anything.
  > With a fixed version `docker compose pull` fetches the same state, the
  > container restarts and shows the same version. Updating then means editing
  > the line in `docker-compose.yml` and running `docker compose up -d`. The
  > app still reports that a new version is available – that is then a hint,
  > not an instruction for the button.

**What is missing – and why a port forward is still a bad idea:**

- **No encryption.** The app speaks `http`. Through a port forward, the
  password and the session token would travel the internet **in the clear**.
  That is the most serious point.
- **Passwords may be short** (at least eight characters since v1.57.0, four
  before that). Fine at home, thin for the open internet.
- **No second factor**, no sign-in through an external provider.
- **Sessions last 90 days** and live in browser storage.

**The recommendation** therefore stays the **Cloudflare Tunnel** (2.7): it
brings encryption, opens no port, and with an access policy there is even a
second door in front. If you want a port forward anyway, at the very least
use a long, unique password and restrict access to known addresses.

## 3. Users & roles

Nupplo knows three levels, which can be combined:

| Action | Standard | Collector-Pro 💼 | Admin 🔧 |
|---|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| Scanning, collection, lists (wishes), statistics | ✔ | ✔ | ✔ |
| See shopping lists, book items in as "got it" | ✔¹ | ✔ | ✔¹ |
| Create/fill/archive lists, bundle offer | – | ✔ | – |
| See purchase prices & profit, sell list, CSV import | – | ✔ | – |
| Users, roles, API keys, backup | – | – | ✔ |

¹ The Lists tab only appears for standard users when at least one active list
exists.

**Creating a user (admin):** More → 👥 Manage users → name + password →
"Create user". Every user changes their own password and username by
**tapping their name at the top right** (profile popup); the admin can reset
passwords and remove users.

> **What happens to their things when removed:** collection, wishes, lists
> and ticked-off list entries **stay** – they belong to the instance, not to
> the person; only the name behind them goes. The one thing deleted with
> them is their push registration, so their device stops receiving this
> instance's messages.

**Granting roles:** in the user list the **Admin** button makes a user another
admin (👑) or takes the rights away again – but the **last** admin always
stays an admin, so nobody can lock themselves out. The **Pro** button toggles
Collector-Pro mode.

**Granting the Collector-Pro role (admin):** tap the **"Pro"** button in the
user list – it turns green ("Pro ✔"). The role takes effect immediately,
without signing in again; tapping it once more removes it. A typical family
setup: one parent is admin + pro, the child manages their collection with a
standard account.

**Worth knowing:** purchase prices are tracked in the background for *all*
entries – anyone who gets the pro role later sees complete data
retroactively.

### 3.1 Two-factor login (optional, per user)

If you like, you can protect your account additionally with a **one-time code
from an authenticator app** (Aegis, 1Password, Google Authenticator …). It is
the most sensible addition as soon as the app is reachable from outside.

**Turning it on** under *Profile* (tap your name at the top right) → **🔐
Two-factor login**:

1. Enter your password, "Set up" – a **QR code** appears; if you cannot scan,
   type in the key shown below it.
2. Enter the six-digit code from the app and press "Turn on". Only this step
   activates the protection – so nobody can lock themselves out with a key
   that was transferred incorrectly.
3. **Eight recovery codes** appear. They are shown **only this once**:
   afterwards the database holds nothing but their checksums. Print them or
   put them in your password manager.

Turning it on **ends all other sessions** of the account: every device that
was already signed in has to sign in again – now with a code. The device you
are turning it on from stays signed in.

A signed-in device stays signed in for up to **90 days** (`TOKEN_DAYS`); the
code is asked for when signing in, not every time the app opens.

**Do I need it?** The section shows whether the app is **used from outside** –
it notices this from the requests themselves (Cloudflare, Cloudflare Access,
a reverse proxy with port forwarding), not by testing from outside:

- *"🏠 Only used from the home network in the last 30 days"* – two-factor is
  an extra safeguard.
- *"🌐 Used from outside, protected by Cloudflare Access"* – a second factor
  (the e-mail code) already stands in front of the app, provided the Access
  policy only allows your addresses. Two-factor in the app is a third layer,
  not a necessity.
- *"🌐 Used from outside – with no access protection in front"* – only the
  password stands in front of the app. Admins whose two-factor is off then
  also get a notice on the start screen, **once**, with "Turn on two-factor".

**Signing in** then happens in two steps: first the password, then the code.
If you do not have your phone at hand, enter a **recovery code** instead of
the six digits – **in the same field**, not in the authenticator app. On a
phone, tap **"Enter a recovery code"** first: otherwise the field only offers
digits, and the codes contain letters. The dashes may be left out. Each works
exactly once, and the app tells you how many are left.

**Turning it off** requires the password *and* a valid code.

> **Phone lost and no recovery codes left?** Then an **admin** removes the
> second factor in user management. Without that way out, a lost device would
> mean a lost account. The last admin should therefore keep their recovery
> codes especially carefully.

**Worth knowing:**

- A code works **only once**. Someone reading it over your shoulder cannot
  reuse it within the same half minute.
- A clock difference of half a minute is allowed for. If the app stubbornly
  says "code does not match", it is usually the **phone's clock** that is off.
- The second step is throttled against guessing too (see 2.8).
- The app computes the codes according to RFC 6238 – the same procedure as
  every common authenticator app.

## 4. Scanning & adding

### 4.1 With the camera

In the **Scan** tab tap **"Photograph a figure or set"** and shoot the figure
or set filling as much of the frame as possible, in good light. On a computer
you can also **drag and drop** an image onto the scan area or paste a
**screenshot with Ctrl/Cmd+V**. The app shows a list of candidates with match
probability, image, number and – depending on the data – year, average prices
and ownership hints.

**Tips for good hit rates:** a plain background, the figure from the front, no
reflective packaging. For sets the box image or the built model works.

**The camera opens inside the app** (from 2.88.1): tapping shows the live
picture straight away, and **the photo library sits right there beside it** –
an existing photo is the same route, not a different one. Where the device
supports it there is a **light** as well; a button that would do nothing never
appears.

**Zoom** (from 2.88.23): the steps **1× / 2× / 3×** sit above the shutter, and
**pinching with two fingers** works too. Where the device offers it the sensor
zooms itself; otherwise the frame is cropped. The number says how much closer,
not which lens – whether glass or arithmetic gets you there is the phone's
decision, and the app cannot tell.

> **What the viewfinder shows is what gets taken.** That sounds obvious but
> was not true until 2.88.22: the live picture fills the screen and is cropped
> for it, while the photo took the **whole sensor frame**. On a phone held
> upright you only see **26 % of the width** – so the figure you framed ended

**Several figures in one picture.** Recognition looks for **one** object per
request – that is how the service is built. If several figures are on the
photo, it picks one. So that you can see which, the preview frames the
recognised figure in **green**.

So that all of them work in one go anyway there is **🔎 Recognise all
figures** – and since version 1.97.0 the route there is a different one: the
app no longer looks for the figures **itself**, it lets the recognition
service look.

**How that works.** Every answer from the service carries a frame with it – it
always says *where* it looked. The app uses that in turns: recognise, blank out
the area it found in the background colour, ask again. Whatever is left becomes
the most prominent object next time round. As soon as nothing comes back, it
stops – so nobody has to state how many figures there are.

Each round delivers **location and identification in one answer**. The route
therefore costs no more requests than before, but copes with arrangements the
old method failed on: figures that **touch**, **several rows**, things lying
criss-cross. Measured on four clone troopers standing close together: **4 out
of 4 figures, 72 to 91 % certain, in 1.2 seconds** – the old method found
**nothing at all** on the same picture.

> **What used to stand here.** Up to 1.96.0 the app measured how much structure
> sat in each image column and cut in the gaps. That worked for figures with a
> gap between them and failed the moment they touched – there is no gap then.
> Below it sat a control for the number of strips; that is gone too, because
> there is nothing left to set.

**Where even this reaches its limit.** The service always finds the most
prominent remaining object. Very small or half-hidden figures fall through.

**After 10 figures the app asks back.** That is not a technical limit but
consideration: every round is a request to a service provided **free of
charge**. If figures are still left after ten finds, **🔎 Keep looking**
appears – the app carries on where it stopped, and the new finds are added to
the previous ones. Whoever does not continue has lost nothing; whoever wants to
decides for themselves. When nothing more comes back, the button disappears on
its own.

For whatever is left there is the manual route:

For those cases there is the **reliable route**, and it is quick:

1. Drag a frame around one figure
2. **➕ Keep frame**
3. Repeat for every further figure – the kept ones stay, numbered
4. **🔎 Recognise all**

That works with any arrangement, because you set the boundaries instead of
the app having to guess them. **Discard** clears the kept frames again.

The single green frame labelled **"looked here"** is something else: it comes
from the recognition service and shows what it guessed at during the first
scan. As soon as numbered frames appear, it goes away.

### 5.6 Your own photo alongside the item

Above the results sits a checkbox: **📷 My photo alongside the item.** With
it ticked, everything you add from this scan – collection, wish list **and**
shopping list – gets your own photo attached to the item. Think of the
pictures buyers contribute on BrickLink: the **catalogue picture stays** where
it is, yours joins it.

You see them in the **gallery**: tap an item's picture and page through. The
catalogue picture comes first – it shows the figure cleanly cut out – and your
photos follow. On one of yours the top says **"my photo"**, and at the bottom
**🗑 Remove my photo** appears.

With several minifigures in one photo each gets **its own crop**: exactly the
frame it was found in. Whether that frame came from the round-robin search,
from a kept frame or from one you dragged yourself makes no difference. Only
when there is no frame at all does the whole photo get used.

**It is off by default.** The app remembers your choice on this device, so you
do not have to make it again at every scan.

**Just the photo, nothing else.** If the figure has long been in your
collection and you only want a picture of it on file, use the **📷 Just add my
photo** button on the result card. It attaches the photo to the item and
touches nothing else – no second row, no raised quantity, no list entry. The
button works **regardless of the checkbox** above: that one is about adding,
here the photo is the whole point. Afterwards it reads "📷 Photo added ✔".

> Handy for illustrating your collection bit by bit: figure in front of the
> camera, scan, one tap – done. The green badge **"✔ 1× in your collection"**
> on the card tells you right away that you already have it.

> **The photos belong to the item, not to the row.** If you own the same
> minifigure twice – once new, once used – both show the same photos. That is
> deliberate: it is the same figure after all.

> **The upload happens when you add, not before.** Anyone who only looks, who
> cancels the condition step or closes the list chooser uploads nothing –
> otherwise every bit of trying things out would leave images behind that
> belong to nothing.
>
> On arrival the image is scaled down to 800 px and stored as JPEG; that caps
> the disk usage and incidentally strips the photo's EXIF data, GPS location
> included.
>
> **Removing only breaks the link.** The file stays – it may be attached to
> another item, and an orphaned image does less harm than a vanished one.

That one always works: drag a **frame around one figure** with your finger
(or the mouse) and tap **🔍 Recognise this crop**. The cropping happens in
the browser, only the crop goes to the server.

> **How many figures may go into one picture.** The smaller a figure is in the
> photo, the less of it is left once it is cropped out – and that crop is what
> recognition gets. A shelf photo with forty figures gives each of them about a
> fiftieth of the frame; rarely more than a guess comes out of that, and the
> card says so ("only moderately certain"). **Five to ten figures close up**
> beat forty from two metres. Since version 1.91.0 crops are taken from a 2400
> pixel working copy instead of the 1200 pixel preview – every crop therefore
> has **four times the area**, measured on a 12 megapixel photo: 238×334
> instead of 120×168 pixels. That is no substitute for getting closer, but it
> gets out what the photo actually holds.

### 4.2 By search (catalogue)

Below the camera area sits the text search. It understands:

- **Names** ("Shoretrooper", "TIE Striker") – via Rebrickable
- **Figure numbers** (`sw0815`, `col424`)
- **Set numbers** (`75154` or `75154-1`)
- **Plain numbers** are looked up on several tracks automatically – as a set
  *and* as a figure; the app shows what it finds.

The search starts **from three characters** – with a shorter input you get a
short hint instead of a request. The **type** (minifigure/part/set) sits right
next to the name field so you can search deliberately.

**German search terms, no AI needed (since 2.82.0).** The catalogue names are
English; the interface is German. The app therefore ships a dictionary of
about 1,400 German keywords and translates the **query**, not the catalogue.
It strips endings and splits compound words – „Protokolldroide" becomes
`protocol droid`. A local AI is still useful for queries the dictionary does
not fully know, but it is no longer required.

Part and colour can be combined, several times in one query: „Figur mit
blauem Hut, roten Beinen und grünem Torso" matches only figures where all
three come together. A single everyday word such as „Kopf" or „gelb" matches
a lot on purpose – the vision model writes „torso …" and „yellow head" for
almost every figure, so such a word counts in the image description only **in
combination**.

You get **10 hits per page**; below them it says "X of Y shown" plus a **Load
more results** button that appends ten more each time – so every match is
reachable.

**Detail view.** Tapping a hit – from the search **as well as from a scan** –
opens a popup with everything that is known: a large image, year, theme,
average prices new/used, a BrickLink link. For **minifigures** you can unfold
"Parts it contains" there: every part with number, quantity and **colour name**
– handy for judging an incomplete figure at a stall. The buttons for adding it
are the same as on the card.

### 4.3 Actions on every result card

- **＋ To the collection** – asks for the **condition** (used/new) and offers
  an optional **"Paid €"** field: if you already know what you paid, enter it
  right away (it lands as the purchase price in the collection). If the item
  already exists, its quantity goes up.
- **☆ Save** – puts it on the wishlist (a ⭐ badge appears).
- **🛒 List** *(pro only)* – puts it on a shopping list (see chapter 7): in the
  dialog optionally pick the **condition** first (used/new, used is
  preselected), then tap the list – or create one right at the stall with
  **"＋ New list"** (the name "Flea market \<date\>" is pre-filled).

Result cards also carry hint badges: **✔ n× in your collection**, **⭐ on your
wishlist** and **🛒 on »list name«** when the item is already planned on an
active shopping list – the built-in protection against buying or planning
something twice.

If a figure you found belongs to a **set in your collection** and is still
missing there, instead of "📦 in sets" it says clearly in red: **🧩 missing
from your set: \<set name\>**. At the flea market you see immediately whether a
find closes a gap. If you already own the figure, the normal "in sets" hint
stays.

### 4.4 Adding manually

For everything without a BrickLink number (custom builds, job lots):
**✏️ Add manually** with a free name, your own number, type, quantity,
condition, an optional **"Paid €"** (purchase price) and notes. Such entries
get no automatic market prices – the purchase price you entered and the notes
work normally.

While you type the name the app suggests catalogue matches in parallel; if one
fits, a tap takes over its number and image.

*(Pro)* **"🛒 Onto a list"** puts the entry straight onto a shopping list –
including custom builds that appear in no catalogue.

### 4.5 Custom figures

The switch **"🎨 Custom figure"** in the manual form is meant for your own
builds:

- **The app assigns the number** in sequence (`custom-001`, `-002`, …), which
  you can overwrite if you keep your own scheme.
- **Your own image**: upload one – or, if the scan recognised nothing, use
  **"📷 Use the photo from the scan"** to take the picture you just shot. The
  scan page also has the button **"🎨 Custom figure with this photo"** for
  that.
- Custom figures are **not** looked up at BrickLink; there are no prices or
  catalogue images for them.
- In the collection they live under the theme **"Custom"**.
- In the trading network their picture travels along, downscaled (chapter 12).

## 5. The collection

### 5.1 Overview & filters

The **Collection** tab shows all items as cards. At the top: full-text search
(with a 🔍 icon in the field and **✕ to clear**), sort order (newest, name,
value …) and the type filter (all / figures / sets). The key-figure widgets
(quantity, total value) always refer to the current filter.

While the collection loads, a **brick** spins with the note "Loading the
collection …" – the search bar is usable already. So that large collections
open quickly, cards initially build only their header; the detail area appears
when you unfold it.

**The list arrives in blocks.** On opening, the first 60 cards are there; the
rest follow as you scroll – you will not notice unless you jump to the end
with the scrollbar. With 815 entries that is about 2,000 elements on opening
instead of 14,700. Leave the tab and the collection gives its space back,
rebuilding when you return; the data stays in memory meanwhile. If the search
finds nothing, it says so – with a button that clears the filters.

**Sorting by theme.** If you pick "Theme" as the sort order, the collection
shows **collapsible theme cards** – Star Wars, City, Harry Potter, Custom,
"Without a theme" – each with count and value. The app derives the theme for
minifigures from the number prefix (`sw…` → Star Wars) and fetches it for sets
from BrickLink; under *More* it can be filled in for existing data.

> **When BrickLink stays silent:** a set's category id does not always appear
> in BrickLink's category list – then the chain stops at the very first link
> and the set ends up under "Without a theme", even though it is clearly
> listed there. In that case the app asks the **figures inside the set**: if
> there are `sw…` numbers in it, it is Star Wars. Whatever occurs most often
> wins. This requires the set contents to have been loaded already – which
> happens by itself when the set is added.

**Parts and their theme.** For parts, "🔄 Reload themes" queries the catalogue
in two stages:

1. **Second number.** Printed parts often carry the number of the figure they
   belong to. The carbonite block with Han Solo has `sw0978` next to it – and
   `sw…` means Star Wars. That is a **real theme**, so it takes precedence.
2. **Catalogue path.** If a part has no second number – the Gungan shield
   `2586ps1` has none – the category counts: *Catalog: Parts: Minifigure,
   Shield* becomes the theme **"Minifigure, Shield"**. That is a shape rather
   than a theme in the narrow sense, but it files the entry somewhere sensible
   instead of leaving it under "No theme". If you dislike it, set "Star Wars"
   by hand on the card – anything set by hand stays.

> **Two catalogues, two numbers.** Rebrickable calls the same parts
> `87561pr0001` and `2586pr0028`, BrickLink `87561pb01` and `2586ps1`. Asking
> one catalogue with the other's number yields **nothing at all** – neither the
> second number nor the category. So the app settles the number **once** via
> Rebrickable and uses it for both routes afterwards. This needs both keys.

If anything is left afterwards – a plain brick has no figure number – the card
details hold a **Theme** field: type it (the suggestion list knows every theme
you already have), press **Set** – done. Clearing it restores "No theme".

**Once the lookup found one, only the theme is shown since 2.14.0** – a field
and a button for something that is already filled in correctly would be two
rows too many. The **✏️** next to it brings them back when something really is
classified wrongly. A theme set by hand stays put; the automatic lookup never
overwrites one that is already there.

> The value of a theme card counts figures that sit inside your own sets only
> proportionally – exactly like the total at the top. Otherwise the sum of the
> cards would exceed the total value.

**Your profile remembers the sort order you last chose** – it applies again
next time, on another device too. The default can be set under *More →
Collection sort order*.

**"Value" is the market value per piece** according to BrickLink, not the
purchase price. Collector-Pros get three more sort orders: **Paid (high →
low)**, **Profit (high → low)** and **Profit (low → high)**. Profit means the
value of the whole row minus what was paid, so the last one shows losses
first. Entries without a purchase price come last.

The **view switch** next to the filters (icon plus label on wide screens)
toggles between **list view** and **grid** (several figures per row, compact,
with a quantity badge in the corner); the button shows which view you are
switching to, and the choice is remembered per device. In the list the
**product image** also shimmers as a subtle card background. Two cards in a row
are always **the same height**, even when a name wraps.

### 5.2 The card details

Tapping a card opens the details as a **popup** – a centred window above the
list, nearly full screen on a phone. Close it with **✕**, a click beside it or
**Esc**; changes are saved immediately and show up in the list once closed.

**A head on top, three tabs below** (from 2.88.0). Before that four sections
sat one under the other, and you scrolled past everything you were not looking
for.

**The head** answers what you want to know on opening, without a single tap:
the **image across the full width** on white, then name, number and condition,
then the tags (theme, year, trading). For dealers there are **three tiles**:
**paid**, **value**, **profit** – paid carries a small ✏️, it is the only thing
in the head you edit.

**The three tabs** split the rest by the question you have:

| Tab | Content |
|---|---|
| **Copy** | quantity, condition, purchase price, trading |
| **Prices** | the averages with ↻ and the price history |
| **More** | BrickLink, contained parts/figures, notes |

A tab with no content is not drawn at all, and if only one is left the tab row
goes with it.

**The theme sits in the head as a tag** – it belongs to the figure, not to
what you do with it, and is therefore **not editable**. A **✏️** appears only
on entries you created yourself (`fig-…`, `manuell-…`); without it those would
stay themeless forever. Everything from the catalogue brings its own theme.

The popup shows:

- **Quantity** (± stepper) and **condition** (used/new) – changes take effect
  immediately, without closing the card. **New and used are separate
  entries**: the same figure can sit in the collection once as new and once as
  used, each with its own quantity, its own purchase price and a value matching
  its condition. If you switch an entry's condition to one that already exists,
  the app merges the two (quantities and purchase prices are added up).
- **Purchase price** *(Collector-Pro)* – just type it in; it saves itself when
  you leave the field (or press Enter).
- **Notes** – free text, e.g. origin or peculiarities; they save automatically
  shortly after typing (a "✓ saved" confirms).
- **Prices**: current averages (new/used); the **↻** on the "market prices"
  block fetches them again immediately, and the **price history** shows them as
  a chart (blue = new, green = used) with a link to the BrickLink price page.
  Above it sit the ranges **1M / 3M / 1Y / All** – they only hide what is
  already there and therefore cost no request. **Tapping the curve** shows the
  date and both prices at that point; on a finger the reading stays until you
  tap again or switch range (under a pointer it disappears as you move away,
  because there you read in passing).
- **Tapping the image** opens the large view.
- **Deleting** via the **bin next to the quantity** (it appears as soon as only
  one is left) – with a confirmation.

#### Image missing or wrong?

At the bottom right of the image sits a small **↻ icon**. It fetches the
current catalogue image from BrickLink and stores it permanently – handy for
entries that arrived without an image (for instance through the CSV import).

*(Requires a stored BrickLink key.)*

### 5.3 The same number, recorded twice

The box says **21306**, BrickLink lists the same set as **21306-1**. If you
enter one by hand and scan the other, you have two rows for one set – and the
collection counts it twice.

The app notices and puts a note on the **scan page**:

> 🔔 **The same set recorded twice?**
> "The Beatles Yellow Submarine" is in the collection as 21306 and as
> 21306-1 – on BrickLink that is the same number, the suffix belongs there.
> **Merge them?** [ One copy ] [ Two copies ]

- **One copy** – the same box, recorded twice. One row remains, with the
  quantity of the BrickLink number; the purchase log of the abandoned row
  goes, otherwise the amount would be in there twice.
- **Two copies** – you really own two. The quantities are added up and both
  purchases stay in the log.

The row that stays is the one with the **BrickLink number**: it has prices,
set contents and matches the catalogue – **including its name**. The
catalogue name wins over the one you typed.

**Prevention instead of clean-up.** When you **enter a set by hand**, the app
adds the suffix itself: type `21306` and you get `21306-1` – landing straight
away in the same row as a scanned copy. If the BrickLink keys are configured
the **catalogue name** is taken as well; without keys the typed one stays.
This also applies to the wishlist and the CSV import.

> Only what is unambiguous gets touched: a plain number on a **set**. Figure
> numbers (`sw0312`), part numbers, your own numbers (`manuell-…`) and
> anything that already has a suffix stay as they are.

> **Where the app stays out of it:** for two genuine variants – say `21306-1`
> and `21306-2` – no note appears. Those are two different editions, and only
> you know which one you mean.

### 5.4 Sets and their figures

Nupplo knows the figure inventories of your sets (via BrickLink, loaded
automatically):

- The set card shows **"👥 3/4"** discreetly in its info line – three of the
  four figures it contains are in the collection; when complete it says
  "👥 4/4 ✔".
- In the set details, **"👥 Figures it contains"** lists every figure with
  ownership badges; missing ones can be put **on the wishlist all at once**
  with one button.
- The other way round, figure cards show **"📦 from your sets"** with a jump to
  the respective set card.
- In the figure details (search as well as collection), sets from **your
  collection** are marked as **yellow chips with ✔** and jump to the set card;
  sets you do not own appear as blue BrickLink links.

### 5.5 Purchase prices & profit *(Collector-Pro)*

Every entry carries a **purchase price** (the total for that line):

- **⚙️ automatic**: without a manual entry the app inserts the BrickLink
  average price of the day it was added (matching the condition). The tooltip
  names the date.
- **✏️ manual**: overwritable at any time via the compact field
  "Paid [amount] €". Manual values are never touched by any automation again.
- When further copies arrive (scan merge, "bought" from the wishlist), the
  purchase price grows by that day's value or the amount you entered.

**Several purchases of the same item.** The same set once at LEGO for 39.99
and once in a shop for 34.99: in the collection that is **one** row with
quantity 2 – number, type and condition are unique. The total was always
right, but which purchase was which could no longer be told.

So below the profit line there is a **purchase log**:

| | | |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1× | 39.99 € | LEGO Store · 14/06/2026 |
| 1× | 34.99 € | MediaMarkt · 02/07/2026 |

The **＋** at the end of the paid row opens a small window: total price of
this purchase, quantity and optionally the source – all at once. The entry's
quantity grows with it. The
**✕** takes a purchase back, quantity included. The list only appears from the
second entry onwards – with a single one it says nothing that is not already
above. The same applies to figures as to sets.

> The "Paid" field above still holds the **total**, and that is what
> statistics, profit and the shopping lists work with. If you type an amount
> there by hand you mean the whole line – the purchase log is then reset to
> that single entry, so that total and breakdown cannot drift apart.

Below it the **profit line** calculates live: *Value 47.60 € · **+35.10 €***
(green = profit, red = loss; value = current average price × quantity). It
does not repeat the amount paid – that sits one line above in the field.
Without a market price the line stays away.

---

## 6. The wishlist

**Where it lives:** since 1.62.0 wishes, shopping lists and the archive share
the **Lists** tab – three sub-tabs above the view:

| Sub-tab | Contents | Visible |
|---|---|---|
| ⭐ **Wishes** | everything you saved | always |
| 🛒 **Shopping** | active shopping lists, sell list, missing set figures | when there are lists or you are a pro |
| 📦 **Archive** | lists you have worked through | likewise |

Before that these were two entries in the bar for the same question – *what do
I still want, what do I take along?* – and the archive was a button that showed
the same cards with a different symbol. Now it is an area of its own, and
archived lists are dimmed as well.

The **⭐ Wishes** sub-tab collects everything you saved – with image, average
prices and widgets that add up the estimated cost of acquiring it (used/new).

- **✔ Bought!** asks for the condition and moves the item into the collection.
  *Pros* can enter the real purchase price while doing so (empty = BrickLink
  average, automatic ⚙️).
- **Correcting a number:** in the details a wrong number can be replaced
  ("Set") or looked up automatically ("🔍 Auto") – prices are fetched again
  right afterwards.
- Items you already own carry an ownership badge – handy against buying
  something twice.
- If a saved figure belongs to a **set from your collection** and is still
  missing there, the card says **🧩 missing from your set: \<set name\>**.
  Tapping the set jumps straight to it in the collection.

## 7. Shopping lists – flea-market mode

The centrepiece for Collector-Pros: shopping in a structured way, with market
knowledge. Standard users see active lists and may book in items that arrived;
everything else is a pro matter.

> **The view keeps itself current.** Every five seconds Nupplo asks
> whether anything in the data has changed – and reloads the open view **only
> then**. So if a family member puts something on a list from their phone, or
> a tool talking to the interface does, it appears seconds later. No reload,
> no window switching, and the list does not collapse in the process.
>
> What is fetched is not a body of data but a **fingerprint**: a handful of
> numbers. Only when that changes does a real load happen.
>
> The **Scan tab is exempt** – there may be a photo with results sitting
> there, and nothing may sweep that away. A tab in the background does not ask
> at all. And on top of that the app refreshes when you return from another
> window after a few seconds.

### 7.1 The typical routine at a stall

**1. Create a list.** Either in the **Lists** tab ("New shopping list …") – or
directly while scanning: the **🛒 List** button always offers **"＋ New list"**
as well, with a pre-filled name such as "Flea market 09/07". Two taps, and the
list exists along with its first item.

**2. Scan through the box.** Put every interesting find on the list via 🛒 –
you pick the **condition** right in the dialog (used is preselected), and if
you already know the price (a tag at the stall) you can optionally enter it in
the **"Spend €"** field – it lands as the purchase price on the list item. Both
can be changed later on the list item itself (the yellow toggle and the spend
field). The same item in the same condition again = the quantity goes up;
**different conditions are separate lines** with their own market values.
Everything calculates per condition.

**3. Read the market value.** The list header continuously shows: *"7 items ·
7 open · market value approx. 86.40 € (per condition)"* – your negotiating
basis, without the seller noticing a thing.

**4. Make an offer: 💰 bundle offer.** The dialog shows the average market
value of all open items and a **red price suggestion** (60 % of the market
value by default – tapping it takes it into the field; the percentage can be
set under More → 💼 Collector-Pro). Once you agree, enter the final price and
press **"Distribute"**:

> **The distribution maths:** the total price is spread across the open items
> in proportion to their market value. Example: a box for 40 €, containing
> figures worth 60 / 30 / 10 € → shares of 24 / 12 / 4 €. Items **without** a
> BrickLink price receive the average share of the others; rounding remainders
> are absorbed by the last item, so the sum matches exactly. The offer can be
> redistributed as often as you like, and individual prices stay correctable
> by hand ("Spend … € ✓").

**5. Book it in at home.** When the finds arrive or get sorted, **anyone**
(even without the pro role) taps **"✔ Got it! Into the collection"**. Confirm
the condition (the stored one is marked with ✓); pros can adjust the price
again – it is pre-filled with the list's purchase price. Items booked in are
**greyed out** with the note *"✔ in the collection, by sammler on 09/07/2026"*.
Into the **notes** of the collection entry the app automatically writes which
list the item came from (e.g. *"From list »Flea market Riem« (09/07/2026)"*) –
an existing note is kept, the hint is appended.

### 7.2 When the item is already in the collection

When booking in an item that already exists, the app asks:

- **＋ In addition** – the quantity goes up; the **average** of the previous
  and the new price is entered as the purchase price.
- **Overwrite** – the collection entry is replaced completely (quantity,
  condition, name, purchase price of the list item).

### 7.3 Purchase-price priority when booking in

1. The price entered in the booking dialog *(pro)* → ✏️ manual
2. The purchase price stored on the list item → ✏️ manual
3. The BrickLink average of the chosen condition → ⚙️ automatic

### 7.4 Archive

Once the **last** item is booked in, the list moves into the **archive**
automatically 🎉 – the third sub-tab in the Lists tab. Only pros can
reactivate lists,
archive them by hand or delete them – and **undo** bookings (↩︎; the
collection entry deliberately stays and is adjusted manually if needed).

### 7.5 List as PDF – for buying or for selling

Every list has **“📄 PDF”** at the bottom. It asks which version you want,
and the instance builds a finished PDF from it. On a computer it is
downloaded; on a phone you get “PDF is ready”, and tapping **“📤 Share or
save”** opens the share sheet – Save to Files, AirDrop, Mail, Messages.

- **🛒 Shopping list** – every item with picture, condition, quantity,
  average price and total, plus purchase prices you entered and a box to
  tick off on paper. Items already booked in appear struck through and
  ticked.
- **💰 Sales list** – for the buyer: only the **open** items, one price per
  piece and the total. The price is the average market value for the
  condition or a share of it (**“% of market value”**, e.g. 90).
  **Your own purchase prices never appear on it.**

At the top: list name, date and the key figures; at the bottom, where the
prices come from.


### 7.6 Sales lists – ticking off removes from the collection

A list can also do the opposite: with the **pencil ✏️** next to its name it
becomes a **💰 sales list**. It then carries a “Sales list” label, and
instead of “Got it! Into the collection” every item has **“✔ Sold – out of
the collection”**.

- **Ticking off takes the pieces out of the collection** – from the row with
  the same number and condition. The purchase log goes along (newest
  purchase first), and if they were the last pieces the row disappears. The
  notes record when it was sold via which list.
- **The price field holds the proceeds**, not a purchase. It does not count
  towards the purchase total in the statistics.
- **Total proceeds** for everything at once go in via **“💰 Total price”** at
  the bottom: the amount is split across the open items by market value, and
  each one gets its share in the price field. The suggestion next to it is
  the full market value here.
- If the item is not in the collection in that condition, or not often
  enough, the app says so and changes nothing.
- **↩︎ Undo** puts everything back exactly: quantity, purchase log and note –
  even a row that disappeared completely when it was sold.
- Items on a sales list do not count as “on the way” for the wish list and
  missing set figures.
- The PDF (7.5) suggests the sales version for sales lists right away.
- **Offer on the trading network:** below the list there is
  **“🤝 Offer on the network”**. The open items appear on the network for
  sale – as many pieces as the list says, at the price from the price field
  per piece (otherwise the average market value). Others see the price on
  the offer. Items currently on offer carry “🤝 on the network”.
  - Ticking an item off as sold on the list takes it off the offer.
  - If it is sold via the network and **given out** there, the list ticks it
    off by itself (“sold via the trading network”) – without touching the
    collection a second time.
  - **“🤝 Take off the network”** withdraws the list’s offers.

## 8. The sell list (duplicates)

*(Collector-Pro only – the "📋 Sell list (duplicates)" button under
**Lists → 🛒 Shopping**.)*

At the press of a button Nupplo produces the list of all items you own
more than once – calculated live, no maintenance needed. The basic rule:

> **"As many figures stay as your sets need – but at least one."**

If a figure exists in both conditions, the keep share is preferably assigned to
the **new** copies – the used ones are the first that can go.

Each line says **why** something stays behind: if the figure is needed for your
own sets, it says "*N× reserved for sets*". If it sits in none of your sets,
only the one keep copy stays – then it simply says "*1 kept*".

Concretely: for every figure the **set demand** is determined (inventory
quantity × how often you own the set). Only what exceeds `max(set demand, 1)`
can go. Examples:

| owned | needed in sets | stays | can go |
|:-:|:-:|:-:|:-:|
| 3× | 2× | 2 | **1×** |
| 2× | 0× | 1 | **1×** |
| 2× | 2× | 2 | *does not appear* |
| 5× | 3× | 3 | **2×** |

Every line shows the condition, "n× owned (m× reserved for sets) → x× can go",
the average unit price for that condition and the sale value; the totals are at
the top. **"As CSV"** exports it for your own calculations, **"Print"**
produces a tidy price list for the stall. Duplicate **sets** themselves can go
normally – the reservation protects the figures *for* the sets, not the sets.

### 8.1 Missing set figures

The counterpart to the sell list sits next to it: **🧩 Missing set figures**
shows, **across all your sets**, which minifigures are still missing.

At the top is the summary ("6 figures missing in 2 of 5 sets · buying them
costs approx. 14.24 €"), below it per figure:

- image, name and number
- **"3× missing (1 of 4 present)"** – the demand takes into account **how
  often you own a set**: two TIE Fighters with two pilots each make a demand of
  4
- **📦 for:** the sets that need it – tappable, jumps to the set
- the average price, if known (from the wishlist or the price history)
- **☆ Save** or the note "⭐ on the wishlist"

At the bottom: **☆ All onto the wishlist**, **As CSV** and **Print** – the
ready-made shopping list for completing your sets.

> **Names and images missing?** These come from the stored set contents, which
> older versions created without them. If a note with the button **🔄 Fetch
> names & images** appears at the top, it gets them from BrickLink (with a
> progress display). With many sets, feel free to press it twice.

---

## 9. The statistics tab

Visible to everyone (📊 in the tab bar), loads automatically when opened:

- **Key figures**: items, distinct items, average value per item, total value
  – *pros* additionally see "total paid" and "profit" (green/red; calculated
  only over entries with a purchase price, so nothing is distorted).
- **Value over time**: the whole collection as a curve, fed from your own price
  log. It calculates with *today's* quantities – the curve answers "what would
  our collection have been worth on day X". It gets more meaningful with every
  week.
- **Breakdown**: bars by type (figures/sets/parts) and condition (new/used),
  each with count, value and percentage.
- **Value by release year**: a bar chart across all years; the top year is
  labelled, tapping shows details.
- **Top 10 by value** with images – and for pros the **biggest value gains**
  (current value minus purchase price, top 5).
- **Spend on lists** *(pro)*: the sum of all purchase prices entered. On the
  overview only **open** lists count deliberately – that is the money currently
  "in transit". A tap opens a popup with **all** lists, archived ones included,
  itemised. There you can tick **"inventoried"** per list: whatever has been
  booked in and taken into the collection drops out of the calculation without
  having to delete the list.

> **How the total value comes about** – and why set figures only count
> once in it – is in [chapter 13](#13-the-price-automation-in-detail).

## 10. CSV import, export & printing

*(Export & printing under More → 📤 Export & print; the CSV import lives in
the card More → 💼 Collector-Pro.)*

### 10.1 Export & printing (all users)

Collection and wishlist as **CSV** (semicolon-separated, works with
Excel/Numbers) or as a **print view** – a tidy table with page breaks, ideal
for insurance or the display cabinet.

Headings, file names and the number format follow the **language you have
set**, the money columns follow the **currency you have set** – in English the
file is called `nupplo-collection.csv` and the column `avg used (GBP)`.

The collection CSV also contains **Theme** and – for Collector-Pro users –
**Paid**. That way it can be read back in through the CSV import without
losing purchase prices or themes.

### 10.2 CSV import *(Collector-Pro)*

Read whole inventories in one go – an Excel sheet, say, or a BrickLink
inventory list. **"Load sample CSV"** provides a correct template. The format:

```csv
Nummer;Typ;Name;Anzahl;Zustand;Bezahlt;Jahr;Notizen
sw0815;Figur;Shoretrooper;2;Gebraucht;24,50;2016;Flea market
75154;Set;TIE Striker;1;Neu;89,99;2016;
col424;Figur;;1;Gebraucht;;;empty name: the number is used as the name
```

The rules – deliberately forgiving:

- **Only "number" is required**; column order does not matter, detection is by
  column name (English works too: `qty`, `condition`, `paid` …).
- Separator semicolon **or** comma (detected automatically).
- Defaults: type figure, quantity 1, condition used, empty name → number.
- "Paid" understands German amounts ("24,50", with € too) and is taken over as
  a ✏️ manual purchase price.
- **Existing items** are merged (quantity added, purchase price summed).
- Faulty rows do not abort anything – they are skipped and reported with their
  line number ("3 new, 1 merged, 2 errors").

Names, images, prices, years and set contents are fetched by the app in the
background after the import (see chapter 13) – with large imports that takes a
while. If you would rather not wait, trigger it by hand under **More →
Maintenance**: since 2.18.0 **🖼 Fetch images now** also resolves missing image
addresses, and **🔄 Retry priceless items** also covers the ones never tried.

> **Do not forget the "type" column.** Without it every row counts as a
> *minifigure* – a set then lands as a minifig, and prices, themes and filters
> never match again. Recognised are `Typ`, `type`, `item_type` and `Art`.

---

## 11. Backup, restore & updates

### 11.1 Backup (admin)

**More → Backup → 💾 download** produces a JSON file with *everything*: users
(including password hashes), collection, wishlist, shopping lists, price
histories, set links and settings.

> ⚠️ **The file is as confidential as the database itself.** Under
> "settings" the **API keys sit in plain text** – BrickLink (consumer key,
> secret, token, token secret) and Rebrickable. The interface only ever
> shows them masked (`…41c7`); the backup holds them in full, because an
> instance could not be restored otherwise. So do not drop the file into a
> shared cloud folder, and do not attach it to an error report. **📥 restore** brings that state back
completely – after a confirmation showing its date; **all current data is
replaced**. Backups without an admin user are rejected (lock-out protection).

**🖼 Include your own images.** Photos attached to items (chapter 5.6) and the
pictures of custom minifigures are **files**, not database rows – without them
the backup would carry only the reference, and after a move the items would
point at nothing. So the card shows a checkbox as soon as there are any; it
names their number and size and is ticked by default. The images then travel
inside the same JSON file, and on restore Nupplo writes them back under
their old names – so the references still fit. That applies to the backup you
restore at the **very first start** as well (chapter 2.3).

> **When it gets too much:** beyond roughly 150 MB of images a single JSON file
> becomes unwieldy. The app then refuses to include them and says so – in that
> case take the `data/uploads/` folder (or all of `data/`) along via your
> normal backup.

**It also happens automatically:** Nupplo writes a consistent backup of the
database to `data/backups/` every day and keeps the last 14 daily snapshots
(adjustable via the environment variable `BACKUP_KEEP`, 0 turns it off). The
backup card shows the date of the last automatic backup. The daily snapshots
can be selected in the backup card, **⬇ downloaded** (for your own external
storage, say) and **↩︎ restored directly** – the current state is automatically
written away as an additional backup while doing so, so the action is
reversible.

Still a recommendation: pull an extra JSON backup before bigger operations –
and anyone running a NAS backup (Hyper Backup, for instance) should include the
`data/` folder, so a hardware failure is covered too.

### 11.1a Sync for external access

External access with its own database, which therefore also works offline,
syncs with the instance through the `/api/sync/…` interface. It signs in as
in the web app, with username and password, and if needed with a second
factor and the Cloudflare Access service token (chapter 2). Collection,
purchase ledger, wishlist, shopping lists and price history are synced.

- **Who wins?** If both sides change the same entry, the later change wins.
  The losing version is kept.
- **Recorded twice:** if you record a minifigure on the go that is already
  at home, you get the sum, exactly as when adding in the web app.
- **Permissions:** as in the web app. Only collector pros see and send
  purchase prices and the ledger. Only pros change shopping lists, standard
  accounts book items in.
- **After restoring** a backup or a daily snapshot, external access starts
  over and fetches the instance's state. Anything not yet synced there is
  lost, so sync once beforehand.
- **Catalogue:** through `/api/sync/katalog` external access also gets the
  instance's catalogue – with the names the instance filled in through its
  BrickLink access, but without the keys. That way it can look things up
  even when the instance is unreachable. Only changes are fetched.

### 11.2 Applying updates

Nupplo tells you itself: the card **More → 🔄 Version & updates** (admin)
compares the installed version against the latest GitHub release –
automatically at app start and when opening the More tab (cached server-side
for 6 hours), immediately via "Check for updates". It asks the **release
page**, not the GitHub API: without signing in, the API allows only 60 requests
per hour for the whole internet connection, and once those were used up the
notice simply stayed away. If the check fails, the app waits half an hour
before trying again. If an update is waiting, a
toast and a yellow banner with a link to the release notes appear.

> **Checking without signing in:** the running version sits in small print
> below the sign-in card ("Nupplo 2.4.1"). Handy when several instances
> are running and you want to know which one you are looking at – or when
> somebody reports a fault and needs the version to go with it.

How you apply it depends on how you installed.

**With the ready-made image** (the usual way, see 2.2):

```bash
cd /path/to/nupplo
docker compose pull && docker compose up -d
```

On a Synology the same works **without a shell**: *Container Manager → Project
→ nupplo → Action → Build and restart*.

> **This needs a project.** If you created the container by hand via
> *Registry → Create container*, that button is not there – and that is no
> oversight by DSM: a container cannot swap its image, a new image always
> means a new container. With a project the wizard handles it, because every
> setting lives in the YAML. Clicked by hand it means: back up, pull the
> image again, delete the container, create it anew. Step by step in
> [`SYNOLOGY.md`](SYNOLOGY.md).
>
> Take particular care if **no folder is mapped to `/data`**: the database
> then sits in an anonymous volume and the new container gets an empty one.
> Download *More → Backup* first.

> **`update.sh` is not here.** The script belongs to the source code and sits
> neither in the image nor in your folder if you only fetched the
> `docker-compose.yml`. The two commands above do the same – you only have to
> take the **snapshot** yourself: in the app under *More → Backup*. If you
> want the convenience, fetch the script once:
>
> ```bash
> curl -sLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Melle79/nupplo/main/update.sh
> ```

**Built from source:**

```bash
cd /path/to/nupplo
sudo bash update.sh
```

The script first takes a **database snapshot** (the last three are kept) and
then works out from your `docker-compose.yml` how the installation runs:

- if it says `image: ghcr.io/…`, it pulls the new image (seconds)
- if it says `build: .`, it fetches the source from GitHub and rebuilds

**In both cases:** your `docker-compose.yml` and the `data/` folder are
untouched – that is where the database, the backups and your uploaded images
live. Database migrations run automatically on start and are idempotent;
updating repeatedly never hurts. Going *back* to an older version is **not**
provided for: migrations only extend. If you want that anyway, restore the
backup first.

#### Updating from inside the app *(optional)*

With a small helper on the server it also works without SSH: the card
**Version & updates** then shows the buttons **Now**, **In 1 minute** and
**In 5 minutes**.

> For this you need **both** scripts on the server – including with an
> installation from the ready-made image, where they do not come along:
>
> ```bash
> cd /path/to/nupplo
> curl -sLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Melle79/nupplo/main/update.sh
> curl -sLO https://raw.githubusercontent.com/Melle79/nupplo/main/update-watch.sh
> ```
>
> Without them the buttons **do not appear at all** – the app shows a note
> instead. So no dead button leads nowhere.

How it goes:

1. Every signed-in browser shows a countdown at the top ("Update in 1:00
   minutes – please finish your input"). While it runs, the admin can
   **cancel**.
2. Then a **lock screen** appears everywhere: "Installing the update".
3. As soon as the server is back, **the browsers reload themselves** – even if
   the tab was in the background meanwhile.

**Why a helper?** The app runs in a container and cannot rebuild itself. So it
only writes the marker `data/update-requested.json`; the script
`update-watch.sh` on the server picks it up and starts `update.sh`. That way
the app needs **no Docker access** – handing that into the container would
effectively be root on the server.

**Setting it up** – have `update-watch.sh` called every minute (the update
itself takes one to three minutes anyway). On a Synology: Control Panel → Task
Scheduler → Create → Scheduled Task → User-defined script.

| Tab | Setting |
|---|---|
| General | User: **`root`** (otherwise no `docker compose`) |
| Schedule | Daily · start `00:00` · "Continue running within the same day" ✔ · every minute · Last run time: **`23:59`** |
| Task Settings | `sh /path/to/nupplo/update-watch.sh` |

> ⚠️ "Last run time" starts at `00:59` – the task would then only run during
> the first hour of the day. Do set it to `23:59`.

On Linux with cron: `* * * * * sh /path/to/nupplo/update-watch.sh`

**Several instances:** best to use **one task per instance** – that way you see
per instance whether it ran. If you put everything into one task, append
`|| true` to each line, otherwise an error in the first line aborts the second
as well.

**Is the helper running?** The card says so: "✅ The update helper is running" –
or it names the reason if not ("has never reported in" → check the path or the
user; "last ran X hours ago" → check the schedule). Without the helper the
buttons do not appear at all, so the app never waits for an update that will
never come. A log of every run: `data/update-watch.log`.

---

## 12. The trading network

Several Nupplo instances – in one family or a circle of friends, say – can
connect: everyone publishes the items they want to pass on, sees what the
others offer and writes messages about them. All voluntary; without a
connection the tab simply is not there.

### 12.1 What lives where

The go-between is a small **hub**. Important to understand:

- The hub holds **only the published offers** and the conversation data –
  plus, **if you fill it in**, your profile and, **if you switch it on**, your
  wishlist (12.3). Your collection, prices, notes and shopping lists **never**
  leave your own instance.
- **Messages are end-to-end encrypted.** The hub cannot read them; it only
  keeps them until the other side collects them, then deletes them. The
  readable history lives on the instances involved – even long after the hub
  has deleted the envelopes.

> **A limitation worth knowing.** Encryption uses the other side's public key
> – and **those keys are distributed by the hub**. Whoever controls the hub
> could hand out one of their own instead of the real one and read along
> without it being noticed. That is not a backdoor in the program, but it is
> the point at which you have to trust the hub.
>
> Since v1.68.0 there are two things against that:
>
> 1. **The instance remembers the key the first time it sees it.** If a
>    different one turns up later, **nothing is sent** – it stops, with a
>    message. Such a change can be harmless (the other side reinstalled);
>    the only way to tell is to ask. Once it is cleared up, an admin confirms
>    the new key.
> 2. **A safety number to compare.** In a conversation, "🔐 Compare the safety
>    numbers" folds open two short rows of digits: yours and the other side's.
>    Read them out over the phone once – if they match on both sides, nobody
>    is in between. They only change when the key really changes.

### 12.2 Joining

To take part you need an **invite code** from somebody who is already in.
Enter it under **More → Trading network**: the code and the display name you
want in the network, then "Join". The wizard at the very first start (2.3)
asks for the same thing.

The display name is unique network-wide and at least four characters long. It
can only be changed by the hub admin.

**Right after joining** a setup planner walks you through the rest in six
steps: about you, favourite themes, what others see, what you offer. Every
step can be skipped ("Set up later"); each one is saved as you go, and
everything can be changed later under **My profile**.

### 12.3 Discover and profiles

The **Trade** tab opens with **🧭 Discover**. Three sections, all worked out on
your own instance:

- **⭐ Has what you are looking for** – other people's offers that are on your
  wishlist. Your wishlist does **not** leave the instance for this: it is
  compared here with the offers from the hub.
- **🔄 Looking for what you have spare** – members whose shown wishlist
  contains something you have twice or offer. "🤝 Offer" opens a conversation
  with a matching suggestion. Here *you* give something away: once accepted,
  the item is removed on your side and added on the other side.
- **🧩 A good match** – members with the same favourite themes.

**Profiles.** Tapping a name – in Discover or on any offer – opens the profile:
about, area, favourite themes, the **trade record** (offers and completed
trades, counted by the hub) and, if shared, the rounded collection size.
Below it, what the member offers and – if shown – is looking for; whatever is
on your wishlist or spare with you is outlined in yellow.

**My profile** (at the top of the tab) is entirely optional; whatever stays
empty doesn't appear. Two switches start **off**:

- **Show my wishlist in the network** – others then see what you are looking
  for (number, name, picture), and "Looking for what you have spare" works for
  them with you too. The list follows every change. Turning it off makes the
  hub delete it at once; so does disconnecting from the network.
- **Show collection size** – as a rounded number, e.g. "≈ 950 minifigures".

**Inviting others** is allowed for every connected member: "✉️ Invite a
friend" at the top of the Trade tab, next to "My profile". A window opens with
the code, "Copy" and – where the device offers it – "Share", plus three steps
for your friend. A code works once. Everyone has a quota of **three**
invitations (the number in the button shows how many are left) and can
request more from the hub admin. **Hub admins** invite without a quota –
after all, they approve everyone else's requests.

**Item profiles here too:** tapping the name or number of an item – in
Offers, Discover, "I offer", someone else's profile and the header of a
conversation – opens its item profile with prices and sets, just like in
the lists. The buttons (Interest, Request, Offer) keep their job.

**My invitations** (expandable below the button): open invitations are listed
with their code – copy or share again, or withdraw; a withdrawn invitation is
free again. Redeemed ones show by whom and when, and drop off the list after
four weeks. Only your instance knows the code; the hub merely stores a
checksum of it.

### 12.4 What I offer

Under **📤 I offer** in the **Trade** tab is what goes into the network:

- You pick individual items in the **collection**: open a card → "🤝 Offer it
  in the trading network".
- Your own **sales list** goes onto the network via “🤝 Offer on the network”
  below the list – with a **price** per piece (see 7.6). The other side sees
  the price on the card (“💶 Sale · €7.50”).
- "➕ Take over spares" fetches everything from the sell list (duplicates, see
  chapter 8) in one go.
- For figures you own several times you pick the **quantity** that is offered –
  out of three Yodas, just one if you like.
- Every item says whether it is **already published** or still waiting. What
  sits in the hub but is no longer selected here is reported at the top – it
  disappears the next time you publish.

- For every item you choose **what for** it is offered: **🔄 Trade**,
  **💶 Sale** or **both**. Everything starts as trade. The other side sees the
  kind on the card, **🔎 Offers** can be filtered by it, and for a pure sale
  the request suggests buying instead of swapping.

The selection only becomes visible through **"📤 Offer in the network"**
(admin). Until then nothing changes in the network. Custom figures travel with
a downscaled thumbnail so the other side does not just see a placeholder.

### 12.5 Offers and conversations

Under **🔎 Offers** you find the other members' items, with a search field over
name and number. Tapping a card opens the request window with a suggested
message you can overwrite. If a conversation about that offer is already
running, the chat opens directly instead – the card says so too ("requested ·
open").

Under **💬 Messages** are all the chats. In an open chat new messages
arrive **on their own**, without "fetch". Your own messages say "on its way …"
or "delivered ✓".

The conversation also has:

- **✔ Accept** / **✖ Decline** – declining closes the window
- **🗑 Delete** – removes the conversation here and in the hub, along with the
  envelopes on the other side
- **⚑ Report** – see below

If the other side takes an item out of the network, the conversation and the
area above the history say **"no longer offered"** – as long as nothing has
been agreed. After a trade the offer is gone, of
course; then the note no longer appears.

If the other side deletes a conversation that was **already accepted**, the
agreement stays: the item may be on its way, and **Take over** or
**Remove** keep working. Only replying is no longer possible.

If you leave the network and join again later, your old conversations
appear as **"earlier membership"** – readable, but without a reply field.

### 12.6 Accepted – what now?

"Accept" is only the promise inside the conversation. After that the
conversation leads through **four steps**, shown as a bar above the button:

**✔ Accepted → 📦 Sent → 📬 Arrived → 📥 Added → 🏁 Completed**

Whoever gives the item away sees **📤 Removed** instead of "Added", and before
"Arrived". The button below the history always shows your **own** next step:

| You … | Button | What happens |
|---|---|---|
| give (someone's request to you – or you offered with "🤝 Offer") | **📦 Sent / handed over** | A window with a prefilled message ("📦 It's on its way!"), ideally with a tracking number. Then removing opens right away. |
| | **📤 Remove from my collection** (red) | in case you skipped removing just now |
| receive (your request – or someone offers you what you're looking for) | **📬 It arrived** | Message "📬 It arrived – thank you!", then adding opens right away |
| | **📥 Add to my collection** | in case you skipped adding just now |

The message goes into the conversation like any other, so the other side gets
the usual notice. **Booking only comes after your own step:** removing only
after "sent", adding only after "arrived". For a **hand-to-hand** swap, the
giving side reports "handed over", and the arrival can be confirmed without a
prior "sent".

The conversation list says what's next: *waiting to be sent*, *📦 on its way*,
*not booked yet* – or on the giving side *not sent yet*, *not removed yet*.

A trade is **completed** as soon as **both** sides have booked: one removed, the
other added. That happens on its own, and the list then says "closed". Whoever
hasn't booked their own part yet keeps the button for it. Trades booked before
version 2.89.4 complete at the next sync. With a partner on an older version it
stays at "accepted".

**New or used?** The adding window suggests the condition of the piece that
changes hands. For a request it comes from the offer. With "🤝 Offer" the giving
side sends it along – the condition of its own piece (if it has both new and
used, the one with more copies).

#### What comes in: adding

There you set:

| Field | Meaning |
|---|---|
| **Where to?** | *Collection* – or one of your shopping lists *(collector pro)* |
| **Quantity** | defaults to 1 |
| **Condition** | New / Used – prefilled from the offer |
| **Paid** | optional; goes into the card's purchase log (chapter 5.5) |

The entry is created like any other: if the number already exists, the quantity
goes up instead of a second row appearing. The notes say "Tausch mit …" so you
can still tell later where the piece came from. Picture, number and type come
from the offer; for trades from before version 1.85.0 the type is guessed from
the number (digits only = set) and can be changed on the card. If there is no
picture – for instance when someone offered you something – it comes from your
wishlist or as BrickLink's standard picture.

**The wishlist tidies up too.** If the item was on your wishlist, it leaves the
wishlist when you add it to your collection – it's found, after all. When you
put it on a shopping list instead, the wish stays.

**Promise now, book later.** Booking only happens on the button – between the
promise and the box in your hands there are often a few days, and the price
usually isn't final until then. Until something is booked, the trade carries the
tag **"not booked yet"** in the list. Afterwards the button says when it was
booked; another click raises the quantity.

#### What leaves: removing

For **incoming** requests a piece is leaving. The window names the item, the
other member and how many you have, and asks for the **quantity**. If the
number is in your collection both **new and used**, it also asks **"Which
one?"** – nothing is guessed here, that would too easily be the wrong copy. If
nothing is left afterwards, the row disappears entirely, purchase log included –
exactly as when removing it via the card.

It never happens on its own: without a click on **Remove** in the app window
your collection stays as it is. Until then the trade says **"not removed yet"**
in the list.

If you have published before, the app refreshes your offers on its own after
removing: the network sees the new quantity right away, and whatever is gone
disappears there.

**Accepting and declining** is only for the one who was asked, and only while
the conversation is open. **If the other side deletes a conversation**, it
stays readable for you but is marked "deleted by the other side"; replying is
no longer possible.

### 12.7 Reporting

If something goes wrong, "⚑ Report" sends a report to the hub admin. The
tick **"Include the conversation"** is the only way a history ever becomes
readable: your instance decrypts it and discloses it voluntarily. Without the
tick the admin only sees your reason. There is no back door in the hub.

**The report stays visible.** The conversation then says "⚑ You reported this
conversation on …", and the conversation list shows the tag "⚑ reported". As
soon as a hub admin has dealt with it, it says "✔ Your report from … is done",
and a notice appears among the messages. Whether you also learn *what* came of
it (such as "Outcome: warning") is up to the admin; by default only "dealt
with".

**Questions:** If the hub admin wants to know more, the question appears below
the report in the conversation, with a notice. You can reply or add something
in the field below. Replying to a report that was already done reopens it for
the admin. The reported person notices none of this.

**If you were reported:** the hub admin can issue a *notice*, a *warning* or a
*block* – temporary or until further notice. Notice and warning appear at the
top of the Trade tab with the admin's text until you press "Got it". With a
block, the block notice shows the reason and the end date; a temporary block
lifts itself afterwards. You won't learn who reported you.

**Responding:** next to "Got it" there is "Respond". There you tell the hub
admin how you see things (up to 2000 characters). Only the admin reads it.
Sending again replaces your earlier response. **📣 My messages from the hub
admin** lists every message to you, including acknowledged ones, each with
your response. If the hub admin withdraws a message, it stays there struck
through, with the date and the admin's reason. All of this also works while
you are blocked; the list is then already expanded.

### 12.8 When access has been blocked

A hub admin can block access. The Trade tab then shows a clear notice. What it
means:

- Offers and new messages are no longer possible, and your own offers
  disappear for everyone else.
- **Existing conversations stay readable** – they live locally after all.
- **Nothing is lost.** After being unblocked everything continues without
  reconnecting; messages that arrived while you were blocked are delivered
  afterwards.

Hence the advice on the notice: **do not leave the network.** Leaving releases
the account, and the only way back is a new invitation.

### 12.9 Leaving and pausing

**Leaving** (*More → Trading network → Leave the network*, instance admins
only): the app tells the hub. Your offers, wishes and profile details disappear
from the network at once, and the hub administration lists you as "left on …".
Anyone in a conversation with you sees "has left the trading network" there;
their history stays readable, but they can't write any more. The only way
back is a new invitation; your display name is free again then. If the hub
can't be reached while leaving, the app disconnects anyway and tells you the
hub doesn't know about it – your offers then disappear there with the pause.

**Pause after inactivity:** if you haven't been in the network for a while
(30 days by default, set by the hub admin), the hub hides your offers and
wishes – nobody should send requests to someone who isn't looking in. The next
time you open the app the pause ends on its own. The Trade tab then shows for
two weeks when it ran, and a notice appears among the messages. It's a good
moment to check whether your offers are still right. Your own profile and your
conversations are not affected.

### 12.10 Administration

Managing members, deciding invitation requests, looking at reports, tidying up
offers – that does **not** happen in the app but in a separate admin console.
That keeps administrative rights out of the family app.

## 13. The price automation in detail

So it is clear what happens by itself, and when:

**Fetching prices.** BrickLink average prices (new & used) are fetched:
(1) immediately when an item is added, (2) manually via "update prices" in the
details, (3) automatically by the **background job**: it runs every **12
hours** and takes on items whose prices are older than **7 days**, oldest
first, with a 2 s pause per request so as not to burden BrickLink.

**How many per run depends on the collection.** Enough to get through
everything once in seven days, at least **40** and at most **400**. Up to
2.78.x it was a fixed 40 – two runs a day meant 80 prices, so anyone with
more than 560 items never got through in time. From about **5,600 items**
the cap bites and a full round takes longer than seven days again: better an
honest backlog than a blocked BrickLink account.

**Names for the catalogue dump.** The published dump carries item numbers and
image descriptions but **no names** – each instance looks those up through its
own BrickLink access. That is a one-off of roughly 19,000 requests, sharing the
quota with the prices. Since 2.85.1 the app works out how many per run:
whatever the prices leave over goes to the names. A **fresh** instance has an
empty collection and therefore gets the most – around 3,600 names a day, so the
set is complete in a good five days. With 9,000 items it is 2,180 a day.

> Until a name arrives, the search shows the number. The figure is **found**
> regardless: the image description takes care of that, and it is there from
> day one.

**Price history.** Every fetch creates a history point – at most **one per 20
hours** per item. The value curve in the statistics tab is built from exactly
these points. A manual fetch within those 20 hours updates the most recent
point instead of creating a new one (the chart stays clean).

**Price log.** Under **More → 📈 Price log** *(Collector-Pro)* the app lists
the most recent price updates across all items – with date, item, the prices
found and a badge saying whether the point came about **automatically**
(background job) or **manually** (the ↻ button). So it is always traceable when
which prices were recorded.

**An arrow says where the price went.** Next to each amount a green **↑**
means it rose since the previous point for that same item, a red **↓** that it
fell. Hovering names the old value and the change ("previously €620.00 ·
−€14.50"). New and used each get their own arrow – they do not always move
together.

> **No arrow means nothing to show:** either it is the item's first point, or
> the amount stayed the same. The comparison is made **in cents**, exactly what
> the line displays – BrickLink returns four decimal places, and an arrow for a
> movement invisible in the shown amount would only confuse. Most lines
> therefore carry no arrow: a six-month average moves slowly. That is what
> makes the arrows useful – they mark the exception, not the rule.

**Purchase-price automation.** Entries without a manual purchase price receive
the day's average as a ⚙️ value at the first price fetch (see 5.4). Prices set
manually always stay untouched.

**Taking a set's figures with it.** When a **set** moves into the collection –
by photo, search, wishlist, shopping list or manually – the app then asks which
of the minifigures it contains are included. All are preselected, individual
ones can be unticked, and "take none" skips the question. The condition is
pre-filled from the set and can be changed; figures that sit in the set more
than once are recorded more than once. Without a BrickLink key, or for sets
without minifigures, the question does not appear.

**A bin instead of a minus.** If only **one** copy of an item is left, the
quantity button shows a 🗑 instead of the −. Tapping it deletes the entry –
with the same confirmation as the delete button and, for sets, including the
figures question.

**The same when deleting.** When a set is removed from the collection, the app
asks whether its figures should go too. It suggests exactly the number that
belongs to that set: if you own a figure three times and two sat in the set, it
is reduced to **one** rather than deleting everything. "Keep figures" removes
only the set.

**How the total value comes about – and why set figures only count once.** The
value of an entry is *average price × quantity*, matching the recorded
condition. A **set price** at BrickLink, however, is for the *complete* set –
the minifigures are already in it. Anyone recording sets **and** their figures
separately (which makes sense for the overview) would otherwise have them twice
in the total.

So the app calculates like this: **sets count in full**, and of every figure
only those copies count that are **not** sitting in a set of yours. Bound are
*number of sets owned × how often the figure is in the set*, at most as many as
you actually have. If a set contains two stormtroopers, you own the set once
and recorded the figure 3×, then two sit in the set and **one counts** as a
genuine extra. With mixed conditions, matching conditions are assigned first.
How much was deducted is shown openly under the tiles in the statistics.

The deduction only applies where sets and figures meet in **one** number: total
value, the collection's value widget with filter *All*, the breakdown by
type/condition, value by release year and the value curve. If you filter to
**figures** or **sets**, the **full** value of that group appears; individual
cards and the **Top 10** always show the full individual value. The **quantity**
stays unchanged – the figures are physically yours after all – and
**paid/profit** still calculates with the full individual value.

**Other background work:** missing release years are filled in, and set
contents (figure inventories) are loaded for new sets. CSV imports and manual
numbers (`manuell-…`, `fig-…`) without a BrickLink equivalent stay without a
price – everything else looks after itself.

---

### 13.1 Price region and currency

By default BrickLink delivers the **worldwide** average in euros. Under
**More → 🌍 Price region** (admin) you can set both sides:

**Region** – 21 countries (Germany, Austria, Switzerland, United Kingdom,
Ireland, United States, Canada, Australia, New Zealand, Netherlands, Belgium,
France, Italy, Spain, Portugal, Poland, Czechia, Sweden, Denmark, Norway,
Finland), seven regions (Europe, North America, South America, Asia, Oceania,
Africa, Middle East) or worldwide.

**Currency** – euro, British pound, US dollar, Swiss franc, Canadian and
Australian dollar, New Zealand dollar, Swedish, Danish and Norwegian krone,
złoty, Czech koruna. The conversion happens **at BrickLink**: the app sends the
currency code along and stores what comes back. It keeps no exchange rates of
its own – so there is nothing that could go stale.

The two are **independent**: if you live in Germany but buy on the British
market, set the region to United Kingdom and the currency to euro – or the
other way round.

**On first start** the setup wizard (step 2) asks for both and suggests what
matches your browser's language settings: `en-GB` leads to United Kingdom and
pound, `en-US` to United States and dollar, `de-DE` to Germany and euro.
Changing the country pulls the matching currency along – a currency you then
pick by hand stays put.

**Important – the two-step fallback:** especially with rarer figures there are
often **no sales at all** in a single country. If BrickLink finds nothing in
the chosen region, the app widens automatically – **first to the surrounding
region, then worldwide**. The second step follows the country: North America
for the United States, Oceania for Australia, Europe for Europe. The first
market with real sales counts. That way no item is left without a price; the
valuation is simply mixed then. (If a region or worldwide is set directly, the
narrower step is skipped.)

**Where a price comes from:** in the item details every price row carries the
**flag** of its region – 🇩🇪 for Germany (or 🇦🇹/🇨🇭), 🇪🇺 for Europe, 🌍 for
worldwide. If the app had to fall back, the tooltip says why ("there was
nothing in the chosen area"). On the card itself the flag only appears on a
fallback – there, no flag means: from the region you set.

**Converting an existing collection.** After a change, all stored prices still
come from the old region – **or from the old currency**. Both count the same:
the card shows how many items are affected and offers **🔄 Recalculate prices
now**. Until then old amounts would sit under a new symbol, and that would
simply be wrong.

> Every item costs **two BrickLink calls** (new and used), and BrickLink has a
> daily quota. So the app works in small portions and shows the progress ("120
> converted, 340 to go …"). With large collections feel free to let it run over
> several days – the state is kept, and it always continues where it left off.

Items BrickLink does not know are skipped and ticked off, so the run does not
get stuck on one number.

**Catching up on items without a price.** If the card says "*X* items still
have no price", those were mostly numbers without sales in the chosen region.
**🔄 Fetch missing prices again** re-values exactly those – with the two-step
fallback Europe → worldwide. That also runs in portions. Whatever still has no
price afterwards really was never sold anywhere; such items honestly stay as
"without a price" rather than repeating the run endlessly.

### 13.2 The price log

**More → 📈 Price log** *(Collector-Pro)* lists the most recent recordings with
time, item, prices and source (`auto` or `manual`). Above it is stated **for
how many items the price fetch is older than seven days** – so you see at a
glance how current the valuation of your collection is. If all prices are
fresh, a confirmation appears there instead.

---

## 14. Troubleshooting

### 14.1 The error report (admin)

If something breaks in the app, nobody has to write down "what it said" any
more. Every browser error is reported to your own server automatically in the
background and collects under **More → 🐞 Error report** – including those from
the children's devices. Per entry you find the error text, the place in the
code, how often it occurred, when it last happened, which app version and which
browser; under "details" the complete information.

**Identical errors are grouped.** An error that occurs on every page load does
not create a hundred entries but one with a counter. The list keeps the last
100 distinct errors.

**Server-side failures are included since 2.13.0.** Before, only what nobody
caught was recorded – but nearly every button catches its error and writes it
into a toast. So "Error 502" was on screen while the report said "no errors".
Now every response from status 500 up lands in the log, with the path
(`GET /api/lookup/…`) and the **beginning of the response**. That is what the
decisive question hangs on:

- If it reads `{"detail": …}`, the error comes **from the app** – the text
  next to it says what went wrong.
- If it is an **HTML page** (`<html>…502 Bad Gateway…`), it comes from
  something **in front of it**: reverse proxy, Cloudflare Tunnel, access
  protection. Then the app is not the problem but the way to it – typically
  because the response took too long for the tunnel.

A 404 ("BrickLink does not know this") and a 400 ("input not valid") stay out:
ordinary operation that would only clutter the list.

**"Script error." – the one entry that isn't one.** If a message carries
neither file nor line, the app is not at fault. For security reasons the
browser boils errors from **foreign scripts** down to exactly that sentence
and withholds everything else. The page loads only two files of its own and
embeds no frames – so it cannot be one of ours. The candidates are browser
extensions, content blockers and whatever the browser injects itself (password
autofill, say); on the iPhone that is the most common case. Since 2.4.3 such
entries are labelled **🧩 Not a fault of the app** and carry at least the last
few steps before the error under *Details*.

**Since 2.19.0 it also says who it was** – as far as that can be seen:
injected scripts and stylesheets with an extension address
(`chrome-extension://…`) and elements someone attached to the page after
loading. The same appears in every start line of the memory history under
**FREMD:** – because a crash often leaves no error entry at all, only a
missing sign of life.

> This matters more than it sounds: foreign code runs in the **same process**
> as the app. If it crashes, it takes the tab with it – no matter how frugal
> the page happens to be. The app still removes nothing; it is your browser.

> If it bothers you, try once in a **private window** or with extensions
> disabled. If it stays away there, that was exactly it.

**What is not reported:** API keys and the GitHub token are removed from every
text (`***`) before it is stored or sent. The report goes exclusively to your
own server – the only thing that leaves it is what you send as an issue
yourself.

**Noticing that something happened.** A *new* error leaves a note on the start
screen – with the message and a button that jumps straight to the card. Only
admins see it; the error report sits in an admin card, so for everyone else the
note would be a dead end. There is always **at most one** open: a single
problem often triggers several different errors. Once dismissed, the next
**new** error reports again – the same one a second time does not.

**🔔 Notification on your device.** If you want to know even when Nupplo is
closed, switch on web push in the same card – **per device**, with the
browser's permission prompt. After that a new error sends a message to your
phone or desktop.

> **What goes where.** The keys are created on your server the first time you
> switch it on and stay there – the private part never leaves it. Delivery has
> to go through the push service of the respective browser vendor (Apple,
> Google, Mozilla); web push does not work any other way. That is why the
> message only says "An error has been recorded" – no error text, no number,
> nothing from your collection. The content is encrypted on the way there
> anyway, but what is not in it cannot stand out. **The trading hub is not
> involved.**

Requirements: **https** (so the Cloudflare tunnel or your own certificate – over
plain `http` on the home network browsers allow no notifications) and, on the
iPhone, the app **installed to the home screen**. A **Send a test message**
button checks delivery, so it does not first show at the real error. If the app
is reinstalled, the old address points nowhere – the server clears such entries
away by itself on the next send.

**🩺 Memory trace.** When the browser gives up on the page ("There is a problem
with this page"), it normally leaves nothing behind – no console, no log,
nothing. So the app takes a reading every 30 seconds – JS memory, number of
elements, number of images – and stores it **in the browser**, where it
survives such an abort. After the next start the same card shows what
happened in the two hours before, with a curve.

Vertical lines mark the start of a session. Whether a crash is behind it is
decided by the **goodbye note**: on a deliberate end – reloading, clicking
away, closing – the page leaves a note behind; when the browser kills it, it
does not. The summary therefore tells four cases apart:

| Line | Meaning |
| --- | --- |
| "without saying goodbye" | a real crash |
| "reloaded by hand" | somebody reloaded or pulled down |
| "the app reloaded itself" | e.g. after a server restart |
| "the browser discarded the tab" | it does that when memory runs short |

Every reading also carries the **server's start time**; if it jumps, the
container has restarted.

**If the tab breaks off anyway, it no longer costs anything.** Since version
2.0.0 the app remembers two things in the browser: **which view was open** and
**what stood in the "Add manually" form**. If the app then starts without the
previous session having said goodbye properly, you land back where you were and
the unfinished entry is in the form again. On a normal start this does **not**
happen – the app opens the scan tab as always, because nobody wants to land in
the settings just because that is where they last looked something up.

> Only text is rescued. A selected photo cannot be restored – but a half-filled
> form is what actually hurts.

> **When the curve stays flat and the tab dies anyway.** Then it is not the
> app, and the only place with the real reason is the browser's own crash
> list: `edge://crashes` or `chrome://crashes`. Every entry has a **bucket
> ID** – it groups crashes with the same cause. If every entry carries the
> same ID, it is **always the same fault**, and a fault of the browser.
>
> That is how it went here: 17 crashes across four days, all under bucket ID
> `8e89b35907…`, all with `P6 = renderer` (the tab itself), `P3 =
> Microsoft_Edge_Framework` (Edge's own code), `P7 = 0x6` (SIGABRT on macOS –
> the process aborts itself) and always at the same spot in the program. Three
> of them landed exactly on the moments where the memory trace also recorded
> "without saying goodbye" – the other fourteen the app never saw.
>
> **And how it continued – that belongs to the truth as well.** After the

> appeared right away: different ID, different spot in the program, otherwise
> the same picture – `renderer`, `Microsoft_Edge_Framework`, `0x6`. So a
> browser update can fix such a fault, but it need not: it may just swap it
> for the next one.
>
> **What is left to do**, in order:
> 1. **Turn off hardware acceleration** (`edge://settings/system`) and work
>    that way for a while. Renderer aborts often come from the graphics path
> 2. **Gentle image mode** (below) – if it happens while scanning
> 3. Take **another browser** and leave the app open for an hour. If things
>    stay calm there, the case is clear
> 4. Report an entry via **"Send feedback"**. Reports carrying a **Cab ID**
>    include a real memory dump – those are the most useful ones

**🐢 Gentle image mode.** A checkbox in the same card, off by default. "But
other sites don't crash" – true, and the likely reason is: hardly any other
page gives the browser this work. Nupplo decodes photos, paints them onto
canvases, reads pixels back and re-encodes as JPEG – a dozen times over during
the round-robin search. Browsers like to push that onto the **graphics unit**,
and that is exactly where renderers abort.

The gentle mode walks the same road on foot: decoding via a plain image
element, every canvas in main memory. A little slower, otherwise the same –
same results, same crops.

> **How to narrow it down:** switch the mode on and work as usual for a while.
> If things stay calm, that road was the cause. If it keeps crashing –
> especially **without you having scanned anything** – it is not that, and the
> way forward runs through the browser: test another application, turn off
> hardware acceleration, report it.

> **That is why the image count is shown too.** It is often the real load: a
> 400 px image takes 0.6 MB once decoded, and that sits **outside** the JS
> memory. A view holding 800 images carried over 500 MB that appeared in no
> curve at all. Since 2.11.0 the cards therefore fetch a 160 px thumbnail –
> the same view now comes to 85 MB. If your image count climbs into the
> hundreds and the tab dies, that is the first place to look.

> **What the number says – and what it does not.** What is measured is the
> **JavaScript memory**. Decoded images and the page structure itself are
> **not** in it. If the curve grows, it is the app. If it stays flat while the
> tab dies anyway, the cause is very likely elsewhere – then it is worth
> looking at `edge://crashes` and the browser's task manager (Shift+Esc) to
> see which tab actually grows. That is a result too.

Each session start also records the **device**: system, browser, whether the
app is installed or running in a browser, memory and screen size. When a
session breaks off, the summary works out how long it **ran** – the same
duration twice would be a pattern.

**What happened last.** Below the curve is the **trail**: two readings are 30
seconds apart, and a crash does not wait that long. So whatever is going on is
noted immediately – photo taken (with megapixels and file size), downscaled,
recognition running and done, view switched, and above all: **went to the
background / back again**. Plus the update flow (checked for an update, update
requested, lock visible, server unreachable, server back) and the turn-by-turn
search with every figure it finds. If the last line before a crash says "went to the
background", the page was not in front at all – then the operating system
reclaimed the tab (typically while the camera app is running), rather than the
app choking on something.

The trace stays on the device. "📋 Copy the trace" puts it, trail included, on
the clipboard as text to paste elsewhere.

**An issue at the press of a button.** With a GitHub token stored, "🐙 Create an
issue" turns an entry directly into an issue in the project. The button then
becomes "View issue ↗"; a second click creates no duplicate. Without a token
the error report stays usable – "📋 Copy report" puts the whole list into the
clipboard as text, which you can paste anywhere by hand. "Clear list" tidies
up.

> **When copying does not work.** Browsers are reluctant to hand out the
> clipboard: the modern interface only to *secure contexts* (`https://` or
> `localhost`), the old route only right after a click. So the app tries
> **the old one first, the modern one second** – the other way round the
> fallback would be worthless, because waiting for the modern interface
> "spends" the click.
>
> If neither works, the text is not lost: the app puts it up in a window,

> reason in brackets – it also goes into the trail under *Memory trail*, in
> case somebody wants to look it up later.

**Creating the token** (once, under "GitHub token" in the same card): on
GitHub under *Settings → Developer settings → Personal access tokens →
Fine-grained tokens* create a token, choose **only this one repository** as the
repository access and set **Issues: Read and write** as the only permission.
The app needs no more – and the token should be able to do no more. It then
lives in your database and is never shown in the interface again.

### 14.2 When BrickLink changes or deletes a number

The BrickLink catalogue is not set in stone: numbers get renamed, duplicate
entries merged, rarely also deleted. If that hits an item in your collection,
its price would silently freeze at the old state. The app speaks up so that
does not happen.

**How it notices.** The app fetches prices for every item every seven days
anyway. If BrickLink suddenly answers "unknown" for a number that used to work,
something happened. A number mistyped by hand, on the other hand, triggers no
notice – it never worked.

**The notice** appears at the top of the **Scan** tab, so on the start screen,
and **stays there until somebody dismisses it with the ✕**. It does not
disappear by itself and does not come back after being dismissed – whoever saw
the matter and decided should not be asked again at every price run.

**The new number.** Only when something really is missing does the app look
into the public [BrickLink Catalog Change
Log](https://www.bricklink.com/catalogLogs.asp) and search there, starting from
the last successful price fetch, for the number change or the merge. In normal
operation that page is not touched at all. If it finds something, the notice
names the new number and **"Use this number"** enters it everywhere:
collection, wishlist, shopping lists, the set-figure links and the price
history. Afterwards the app fetches prices under the new number. If the
new number is already in the collection, the two rows are merged. Because
this affects the whole instance, admins and Collector-Pros may do it – the
same goes for merging duplicate numbers and "Reload themes".

**If the log finds nothing** – because the entry really was deleted, say – the
notice stays anyway, just without a new number. Nothing is lost: the item stays
in the collection with its last known price. You can then correct the number by
hand via "Set BrickLink no." in the card details.

### 14.3 Common stumbling blocks

**An update does not take effect / old interface.** Did the update run
through completely? Which version is running is shown in More → 🔄 Version &
updates; after that a normal reload is enough. With the ready-made image, check
that `docker compose pull` really fetched a new image.

**Prices missing on individual items.** Manual numbers have no BrickLink
equivalent. Freshly imported items are served in portions of 40 – be patient or
press the **↻** on the "market prices" block in the detail popup. No prices at
all? → More → API keys → "Test connection".

**Printed parts.** The two catalogues count printings differently: the Gungan
shield is `2586pr0028` on Rebrickable and `2586ps1` on BrickLink, the carbonite
block `87561pr0001` and `87561pb01`. The app looks the BrickLink number up
itself once its own number yields nothing, and remembers it. When the price
comes from that secondary number, it is shown below the market prices –
otherwise you would search for it on BrickLink under your own number in vain.
This needs the Rebrickable key; without it such parts stay without a price.

**"Collector-Pros only" (403).** The feature needs the pro role – the admin
grants it under More → Manage users.

**The Lists tab is missing.** For standard users it only appears when an active
list exists; after archiving the last list it disappears again. Pros always see
it.

**Login no longer works / user forgotten.** You change your own password via
the profile popup (tap your name at the top right); forgotten passwords are
reset by the admin in user management. If the admin themselves is locked out:
restore the last backup or copy `data/brickfolio.db` back from a backup.

**The camera does not open.** Close the PWA once and reopen it; check the
browser's camera permission. On iOS camera access only works through Safari or
the app installed from the home screen.

**Recognition returns nonsense.** Better light, a neutral background, get
closer – or simply use the text search with the number from the leg print or
the building instructions.

## 15. FAQ

**Does Nupplo need the internet?** For scanning, prices and search: yes
(those APIs live on the net). Your own data still stays entirely on your
server. What works without internet is listed in the README.

**Do BrickLink/Rebrickable cost anything?** No, both API accesses are free –
BrickLink only requires a seller account with a store.

**Can my child break something?** Without the pro or admin role they see
neither purchase prices nor list management, archive or import – they can
collect, wish and book in items that arrived. And there is the backup. 🙂

**Where do the prices come from – and how accurate are they?** They are
BrickLink average prices of the most recent sales (new/used separately). They
are a good orientation, not an appraisal – rare conditions, completeness and
region can differ in reality.

**Why does the value curve start so low?** Recording begins with the setup; at
first only a few items are "priced". Once everything has prices, the curve
shows real market movement.

**Several collections/families?** One Nupplo instance = one shared
collection. For separate collections simply start a second container with its
own `data/` folder and port.

**Is this legal with the LEGO name?** Nupplo is a private hobby project.
LEGO® is a trademark of the LEGO Group, which does not sponsor, authorise or
endorse this project; BrickLink and Rebrickable are trademarks of their
respective owners, and their APIs are subject to their respective terms of use.
